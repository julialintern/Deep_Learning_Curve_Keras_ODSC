# KEEPING UP WITH THE DEEP-LEARNING CURVE VIA KERAS



This lesson will help the beginner-level deep-learner navigate this new landscape. I will explain both the design theory and the Keras implementation of some of todayâ€™s most widely used deep-learning algorithms including convolutional neural nets and recurrent neural nets


Will also share my implementation of [FashionNet architecture](https://github.com/julialintern/fashionNet/tree/master/lintern_functionalApi)
